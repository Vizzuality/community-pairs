This is an app to inform the Vizzuality frontend team of the pair programming pairs for each week and also give them some hints on shared interests based on the [skills initiative](https://github.com/Vizzuality/vizzuality-skills).

Right now, until we create some cron job, the update each week is manual so we have to update the EXISTING_PAIRS constant on the pages/index.js. Just add the ones correspoding to the week before so the calculation can be done correctly. The app accepts trios when the developer number is not even.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
